Community Safety App with Alarm Feature
Concept:
A mobile application that empowers communities to enhance their safety through a dedicated group-based alarm system.
Features:
Group Creation: Users can create groups based on their neighborhood, street, or community.
Alarm Button: Each group has a dedicated alarm button that can be activated in case of an emergency or suspicious activity.
Notification System: When the alarm is activated, it triggers a loud siren on the user's phone and sends notifications to all other members of the group.
Member Identification: The app allows group members to identify the user who activated the alarm, enabling quick response and assistance.
Geolocation Tracking: The app can optionally use GPS to track the location of the user who activated the alarm, providing additional information for emergency responders.
Community Alerts: The app can send out community-wide alerts for important safety information, such as crime reports or natural disaster warnings.
